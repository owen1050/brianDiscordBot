try one: every 2 hours it says "react to this for brian role"
react to its own message with specific brian emoji
first one to react to it remove all other brians roles, make this person brian role, delete message


this instead: if any message contains brian, reply
		if its been more than 2 hours, that person becomes the only brian role
		if its been less than 2 hours say how much time is left

cool down so if you @the BrainBot it tells you how much longer you have to wait
leaderboards on how many total hours each person has had the brian role
longest streak of brian role
